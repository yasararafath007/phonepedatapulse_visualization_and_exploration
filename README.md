Project Title: PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization Dashboard

Problem Statement:
Create an interactive and insightful dashboard to visualize and analyze the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository data (https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse) using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. The objective is to provide users with a comprehensive overview of PhonePe's transactions, users, and key metrics across different states and districts in India. The dashboard should include geo-visualization, transaction analysis, user data analysis, and insights into top-performing states.

Outcome:
Successfully designed and implemented a Streamlit web application featuring four main components:

Geo-Visualization:

Utilized Plotly's scatter_geo and choropleth to create an interactive India map showcasing total transactions at both state and district levels.
Implemented zoom functionality and hover displays for detailed insights into specific regions.
Incorporated user input for dynamic visualization over different years and quarters.
Transactions Analysis:

Presented transaction data through various Plotly graphs, including state-wise bar graphs, district-wise studies, year-wise analyses, and an overall trend analysis.
Provided users with the ability to observe transaction trends, identify top-performing states, and explore district-level details.
User Data Analysis:

Visualized user-related data, including registered users' count, app openings by mobile brands, and their distribution across states and districts.
Implemented state-wise and district-wise studies, year-wise analyses, and an overall trend analysis to showcase the growth in registered users and app openings.
Top States Data:

Displayed key metrics for top-performing states, including those with the highest registered users, total amount transacted, transaction counts, and app openings.
Provided insights into the leading states contributing significantly to PhonePe's performance.
Tools Used:

Streamlit:

Developed a user-friendly web application for data visualization.
Enabled dynamic user inputs for customizing the displayed data.
Plotly:

Leveraged Plotly's scatter_geo, choropleth, and various graph types for effective data representation.
Created interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
Python:

Primary programming language for the entire project, covering data processing, analysis, and visualization.
SQLite:

Utilized SQLite for handling the relational database aspects of the project, including storing and querying data.
Outcome Highlights:

Successfully created an interactive dashboard providing in-depth insights into PhonePe's transactions and user-related metrics.
Enabled users to explore transaction and user data at different geographic levels (state and district) over different time periods.
Effectively showcased top-performing states based on key metrics, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of PhonePe's performance.
This project highlights your proficiency in data visualization, web application development, and database management, making it a valuable addition to your resume.
